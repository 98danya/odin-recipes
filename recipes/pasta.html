            <li>Boil a large, salted pot of water for your pasta and cook it according to package instructions.</li>
            <li>Meanwhile (once the pasta starts to cook), add the butter to a skillet over medium-high heat. Once it melts, add the garlic and saut√© for about a minute, stirring constantly.</li>
            <li>Add in the tomato paste, tomato sauce and cream. Stir until it's nice and smooth. Let the sauce cook for about 5 minutes or until it's thickened to your liking (it should be very gently bubbling, so you may need to turn down the heat).</li>
